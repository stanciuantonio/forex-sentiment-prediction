# Description of the idea

Our project aims to build a hybrid pipeline that merges historical price data with daily sentiment scores derived from Forex news to predict EUR/USD movements. We utilize price data (e.g., from `eurusd_daily.csv`, with Alpha Vantage as a potential source for updates) to obtain OHLC history and compute log-returns.

In parallel, we leverage the GDELT dataset as our primary source for news articles relevant to Forex markets. A dedicated pipeline extracts and filters these articles, aiming for a manageable number per day (e.g., 1-3) by relevance and tone. Each relevant news item's content is then processed using FinBERT, a pre-trained language model specialized in financial text, to obtain a continuous sentiment score. These individual sentiment scores are aggregated daily (e.g., by averaging) to create a daily sentiment time series that aligns with the price data.

As a baseline, we will train Gaussian Process Regression and XGBoost models on this combined feature set using scikit-learnâ€™s TimeSeriesSplit for rolling-window cross-validation. We will then train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. The model will use 30-day lookback windows, incorporating both historical price-derived features (like log-returns) and the daily sentiment scores as inputs. For training, each day will be labeled based on a threshold method applied to the next-day log-return (e.g., > +0.2% for BUY, < -0.2% for SELL, otherwise HOLD), a technique supported by financial literature. Rigorous backtesting and reporting of cumulative profit metrics will be conducted throughout the project to ensure the reproducibility and academic validity of our findings.

We chose to focus on Forex markets due to their high liquidity and 24/5 operation, which provide a robust environment for time-series modeling. By integrating price action with sentiment data derived from a broad source like GDELT, and employing deep learning models alongside classical benchmarks, this project seeks to determine if sentiment information significantly enhances price prediction accuracy. This approach aims to provide a clear, research-backed methodology for testing our hypotheses on real-world market data.
